# Weather App using HTML, CSS & JavaScript (API + DOM)

This is a simple weather app made using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets you enter a city name and shows the current weather using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It covers important concepts like using fetch for API calls, handling JSON data, updating the DOM with JavaScript, and showing error messages when the city isnâ€™t found.
